\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}

The most simple method of mining cryptocurrencies is individual mining. However as competition increases the chances of an individual miner finding a new block becomes infinitesimal. Mining pools are used to make it realistic for smaller miners to return profit. In a large mining pool new blocks are regularly found and the profits are distributed in proportion to each miners computational effort. \\

Our goal is to understand the protocols behind mining pools and develop a functional mining pool for SmileyCoin (SMLY), which is a fork of Bitcoin. The mining pool is written in Django, a popular web framework for Python. We start by going over the foundations of the blockchain and its protocols, followed by a general description of how mining pools work, and finally we describe our own implementation.
